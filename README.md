# Introduction

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) website bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It leverages the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, providing a seamless developer experience with built-in support for TypeScript, CSS modules, and more. The project also uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font, ensuring optimal performance and user experience.

# Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for server-rendered React applications.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Framer Motion**: Library for animations and gestures.
- **Radix UI**: Accessible, unstyled UI components.
- **Vercel**: Platform for deploying and hosting Next.js applications.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.0.0 or later) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1.22.0 or later) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v6.0.0 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
